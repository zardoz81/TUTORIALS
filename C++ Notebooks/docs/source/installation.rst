On Linux, installation of the dependencies can be done through the package manager, anaconda or manual compilation.

Using the conda package
-----------------------

A package for xplot is available on the conda package manager.
The package will also pull all the dependencies.

.. image:: cmake.svg

From source with cmake
----------------------

You can also install ``xplot`` from source with cmake. On Unix platforms, from the source directory:
However, you need to make sure to have the required libraries available on your machine.

.. code::

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/prefix ..
    make install

On Windows platforms, from the source directory:

.. code::

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/prefix ..
    nmake
    nmake install
