KUMU instances: (SEE THE PDF 'KUMU.pdf')

Dashboard:
https://dashboard.kumu.oist.jp/project/instances/

1) Create a key pair on the local machine 
	ssh-keygen -t rsa -f cloud.key
	you'll get two files:
		cloud.key     (private)
		cloud.key.pub (public)

2) In Kumu Create a Security Group called SSH

3) Create a VM instance
	- upload your public key
	- attach a floating IP address
	- don't forget to add the SSH security group
	- choose the flavor

4) when the instance is provisioned:
	ssh -i <path/to/private.key> ubuntu@<floatingIpAddress> (higher)
	ssh -i <path/to/private.key> root@<floatingIpAddress> (xenial)
	ssh root@10.155.8.38 -i cloud.key (WHERE THE IP address IS THE FLOATING IP PROVISIONED BY TO THE VM INSTANCE)

install singularity: (see the PDF 'SINGULARITY INSTALLATION.PDF')


5) copy files from you localhost to the VM instance (you'll need the same key)
scp -i cloud.key ./work.sif root@10.155.8.38:.
You can copy it from the guest system (hosted by VAGRANT running on you Mac) 


PORT FORWARDING:

6) if you want to run a Jupyter notebook running in a guest system hosted on a VM, do

Open Terminal
Screen
ssh -L 8000:localhost:8888 root@10.155.8.38 -i cloud.key (THIS MEANS THAT YOU WHAT LOCAL PORT 8000 WILL BE FORWARDED (I.E. CONNECTED) TO REMOTE PORT 8888
Screen
singularity exec work.sif jupyter notebook --ip='*' --port=8888 --no-browser --allow-root (THIS RUNS JUPYTER IN A SINGULARITY CONTAINER ON PORT 8888 THERE)
WE GET: http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=c50dc3e2b2c1373f649d8c89e0eb01b72a787814ba0b32b7
COPY AND PASTE THIS LINK TO YOU BROWSER (BUT CHANGE THE PORT TO 8000) BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS THERE ON PORT 8888 WILL BE FORWARDED TO YOUR MAC'S PORT 8000
ctrl+a+d
ctrl+a+d
Close Terminal
ENJOY!
