# Skill Pills+ 3rd Topic: Neural Coding and Brain Computing

This is a repository for the Skill Pills+ 3rd Topic: Neural Coding and Brain program, being conducted at OIST in Okinawa, Japan from November 8 to 10, 2019.

This repository will be updated to include tutorials, lecture content, and exercises used through the two-day program.

## Program outline

In this program you will learn how to approximate the behavior of biological, spiking neurons using Python. You will learn how such neurons can be connected together to form networks and how these networks can be designed to help study and understand the brain.

The program will take place over two days. Students will be provided with a laptop to use during the Skill Pill+ with all necessary software pre-installed.

On the first day, there will be an introductory lecture to current research in computational and theoretical neuroscience, followed by tutorials in Python and ordinary differential equations. We will also provide an introduction to the neural simulator NEST (https://www.nest-simulator.org/) and students will complete guided basic exercises.

On the second day, students will complete more advanced guided exercises designed to challenge and expand the studentsâ€™ knowledge and ability in programming and neuroscience. This will be followed by a farewell lunch and presentation of certificates.
